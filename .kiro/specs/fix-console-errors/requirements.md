# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing console errors in the ATF-SHOWCASE application. The application currently has configuration loading issues and missing resource errors that prevent proper functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Configuration File Loading

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration file to load properly, so that the application can connect to the Google Apps Script backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL successfully load the configuration from `/env/config.txt`
2. WHEN the configuration file is missing THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user
3. WHEN the SCRIPT_URL has extra whitespace THEN the system SHALL trim the whitespace before using it
4. IF the configuration fails to load THEN the system SHALL prevent API calls and show a user-friendly error

### Requirement 2: Add Favicon to Prevent 404 Errors

**User Story:** As a user, I want the browser to load a favicon without errors, so that the console remains clean and the site appears professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL serve a valid favicon.ico file
2. WHEN the favicon is requested THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code
3. IF no custom favicon exists THEN the system SHALL provide a default favicon

### Requirement 3: Improve Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when configuration fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration loading fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN API calls fail due to missing configuration THEN the system SHALL prevent further API attempts
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information to the console for debugging
4. IF the SCRIPT_URL is invalid or empty THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message

### Requirement 4: Update AppScript Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the appscript.md file to be updated when code changes affect the backend, so that the documentation stays synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend-related changes are made THEN the system SHALL update appscript.md if necessary
2. WHEN reviewing changes THEN the developer SHALL verify if appscript.md needs updates
3. IF no backend changes are needed THEN appscript.md SHALL remain unchanged
